# Genetic Algorithms and the Cobweb Model 

This repo contains the code, output and paper produced as an assignement for the course [Topics in Computational Modelling](https://didattica.unibocconi.eu/ts/tsn_anteprima.php?cod_ins=30592&anno=2023&IdPag=6936) from Bocconi University.

We construct a Genetic Algoritm in order to solve a Cobweb Model of market interactions as did in [Arifovic (1992)](https://www.uh.edu/hobby/eitm/_docs/past-lectures/2014-Lectures/Sunny-Wong/Genetic-Algorithm-Learning-and-the-Cobweb-Model.pdf). Please refer to the pdf file inside the latex folder for a more detailed description.
